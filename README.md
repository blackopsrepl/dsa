# Data Structures and Algorithms Study (WIP)

This repository is a work-in-progress (WIP) collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in **Python**, with plans to expand to **Rust** and **Go**. The goal is to study fundamental computer science concepts and build a portfolio showcasing multi-language proficiency. Python is the starting point to minimize boilerplate and focus on algorithmic logic, with Rust and Go implementations to explore systems programming paradigms.

## Current Status
The repository currently includes:
- **Data Structures**:
  - Singly Linked List (Python): Object-oriented implementation with operations like `add_first`, `add_last`, `insert_at`, `delete`, and more.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Linear Search (Python): Simple iterative search with O(n) time complexity.
  - Binary Search (Python): Efficient search for sorted arrays with O(log n) time complexity.
